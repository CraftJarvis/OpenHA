## Output Format
Action: ... 

## Action Space
* move('dx', 'dy') # Move the mouse position; dx and dy represent horizontal and vertical movement, respectively.
* click('left' or 'right')) # left click or right click the mouse
    - left_click # Attack; In GUI, pick up the stack of items or place the stack of items in a GUI cell; when used as a double click (attack - no attack - attack sequence), collect all items of the same kind present in inventory as a single stack.
    - right_click # Place the item currently held or use the block the player is looking at. In GUI, pick up the stack of items or place a single item from a stack held by mouse.
* press(keys) # press the keyboard buttons
    - 'w' # Move forward.
    - 's' # Move backward.
    - 'a' # Strafe left.
    - 'd' # Strafe right.
    - 'e' # Open or close inventory and the 2x2 crafting grid.
    - 'space' # Jump.
    - 'q' # Drop a single item from the stack of items the player is currently holding. If the player presses ctrl+q then it drops the entire stack. In the GUI, the same thing happens except to the item the mouse is hovering over.
    - '1'-'9' # Switch active item to the one in a given hotbar cell.
    - 'left.control' # Move fast in the current direction of motion.
    - 'left.shift' # Move carefully in current direction of motion. In the GUI it acts as a modifier key: when used with attack it moves item from/to the inventory to/from the hotbar, and when used with craft it crafts the maximum number of items possible instead of just 1.
* no_op # wait and do not interact with the world

If multiple actions are activated, use `, ` connect.
